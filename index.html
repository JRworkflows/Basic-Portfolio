    <p id="AboutP">
        I have a diverse background in Business, Project Management, and Information Technology. 
        Most of my work experience consists of sales management, project assignment to either create or improve processes, and minimizing risk.
        I have been studying Information Technology throughout my working years and am now familiar with a multitude of software, most operating systems, and a few programming languages.
        My strengths are in Database Technologies that revolve around SQL and have struck an interest in noSQL and other approaches in managing data.
        Additionally I am now looking into programming with languages that work well with the foundation I have to make innovative apps to solve problems in multiple business areas.
